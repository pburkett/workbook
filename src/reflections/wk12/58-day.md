# Day 58

## Today I have most of the requirements met, but I'm still missing at least 3. My approach to rendering Keeps and Vaults in a masonry format is proving to be problematic, as I have to resort the arrays every time an element is added or removed. I'm planning on sticking with the approach for now, since I'm almost ready to be graded. Once I'm passing the final, I'll break down the masonry approach and tackle it in the more true CSS approach.
