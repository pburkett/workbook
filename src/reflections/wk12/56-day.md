# Day 56
## __3/1/2021__

## Today I began on the clientside of Keepr. I spent quite a bit of time trying to get a masonry package working, but unfortunately I couldn't get the package to work properly. I switched over to tackling masonry by splitting my data into separate arrays and rendering each as a separate column. Tomorrow, I hope to get the 3 pages laid out and maybe I'll tackle the modals and create requests for Keeps and Vaults.
