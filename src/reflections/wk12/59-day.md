# Day 59
## __3/4/2021__

## I passed the final just before lunch today! I'm still missing two requirements, which I'll tackle in time. I spent the afternoon refactoring my masonry layout. I inevitably hit some hangups with the display types, but It's resolved and working well now. Tomorrow I'll tackle the missing requirements and continue to improve the UI and visuals of the application.
