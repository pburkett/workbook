 ## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
    I think the concept of heirarchy is very interesting and useful. The "Cheating at Design" guide talks about heirarchy most specifically in the portion about buttons, but heirarchy applies to basically every tip in the guide. Breaking your elements into primary, secondary, and tirtiary elements can help you consider how to display them to the user.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design can influence visitors a lot. Having a well thought-out heirarchy of elements and actions can communicate to your users what is most important about a site, and what actions they can take on a page. A logical organization can help users find what they're looking for quickly. Showing your users what other pages they can connect to from a page is important, because you will likely want users to access many pages in order to shop, read, write, or whatever your site does.
