## What is Git, and why is it useful?
Git is a version control system. Git is useful because it allows developers to track the changes they make to their code. If a developer wants to revert to an old version of their code, Git makes that old code easily available. Git essentially gives developers greater control over their workflow, and helps them adapt to issues quickly.

## What are the benefits of branching in Git?
Branching allows developers to commit to different "branches" of code. This can allow mutliple developers to work on the same branch without committing that code to the main stream of code. This is useful for adding large or complicated code to a repository without interfering with the functionality of the main codebase. Once the branch is deemed to be ready, it can be merged with the main codebase. Branching can also be used to build separate, functional applications that share a codebase, with no intention to merge back into the main.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a completely local version control system. It is limited to a single computer, and typically to a single developer. GitHub is a distributed version control system, and a hosting platform. GitHub stores repositories of code in the cloud, and can push that code out to developers who request it (and have permission). GitHub receives it's code by developers who push their locally stored code to GitHub. GitHub also hosts functional websites where developers can interact with their working code.
