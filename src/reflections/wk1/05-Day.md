 ### Reflection Fridays
 The last week has largely sold me on front-end development. I came into this course without very much knowledge of HTML or CSS, or of webpage design as a whole. Boise CodeWork's Scholarship project Moody Kittens required a bit of HTML, and even less CSS, and what CSS I did do I found frustrating. However, both languages have grown on me over the last week. Front-end development with CSS has a charming and occasionally messy kind of logic. The concepts of visual web design are pretty fascinating to me. The ways that website design effects not only the user experience, but the active decisions of the user, are fascinating. The most interesting aspect is how we make websites pleasing to look at. The way that subtle additions of depth, wise use of color, and good proportions effect how a page looks. Overall, I am very excited to get back into JavaScript, but it's exciting to know that front-end development could be just as rewarding for me.
