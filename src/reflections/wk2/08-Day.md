## What are the main methods for writing information to the Chrome console?
Information can be written to the Chrome console from within your code, or directly in the console. Using the "console.log()" method within your source code will allow you to see information directly from your code, as the console.log lines are reached. It is also possible to write information directly in the console; functions can be called, variables can be read, comparisons can be made, and much more.


## Which Chrome Dev Tool allows you to see the breakdown of HTML and CSS on the DOM?
The "Elements" tab allows you to see all your HTML elements and CSS properties, broken down into a very helpful format.

## What are some more efficient methods for debugging code?
The built-in Chrome debugger can be very efficient for debugging lots of code. Simply writing "debugger" in your code will pause the procession of JavaScript, and allow you to advance it line by line.
