## What is the purpose of async / await?
The keywords async and await seek to solve our problems with callbacks, similarly to promises. Async and await allow us to control the flow of our code, and separate responsibilities.

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
The function must be declared with 'async' to indicate it is asynchronous. Then, the promise must be preceded by 'await'.

## What are some of the primary benefits of async / await?
Async and await allow us to chain async events without as much restriction as promises. Async and await often produce simpler syntax that is easier to read.
