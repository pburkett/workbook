## What are props?
Props are a tool Vue uses to pass data between components. Props are limited to parent-child relationships, and can only be passed *by* parents, *to* children.

## What are props used for?
Props are useful whenever we desire a one-to-many relationship between components. A common example is when iterating over arrays and creating many instances of the same component.
