## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
an Enum is a value type defined by a set of named constant Ints. The functionality reflects the iterable properties of arrays in Javascript. They come in handy whenever you need to iterate over collections.

## How can you modify an Enum?
It is possible to manually set the value of the ints used in Enums. For example, by setting the first enum item value to 1, you can start the iteration at 1 instead of the default 0.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I haven't used straightforward enum types in any C# projects. I've used the IEnumerable to handle collections of items as they come back from MySQL.
