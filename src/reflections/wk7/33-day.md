## What is a user experience? What should be considered when developing a user experience?
The user experience is the effect a UI has on users. UX should be used to empower users to take the action they want to take. UIs with clear, actionable elements will help users take the action they want to take efficiently.

## What are some of the benefits of taking the UX into account?
Designing strong UX will make your site a more positive experience for users. The more smoothly users can interact with a site, the more likely they are to seek that site out in the future.
