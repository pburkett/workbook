## What is pair programming?
Pair programming is the practice of writing code in pairs. It consists of two roles, namely a 'driver' and a 'navigator'. The driver actively writes lines of code, while the navigator keeps the bigger picture of the code being worked on in mind. 

## What are some benefits to pair programming?
Pair programming's main benefit is high quality code. The attention of two programmers leads to more well-written code which lessens the burden of code maintenance.

## What are some drawbacks of pair programming?
The main drawback of pair programming is simply the time (and money) spent. It's not likely that a pair of programmers could ever write code as quickly as two programmers working individually. Focusing on lines per minute is a very narrow way to look at code productivity, however.
