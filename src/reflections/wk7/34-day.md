## Which principles from this weeks reading did I implement?
During this week of pair programming, my partner and I succeeded with most of the basic principles of pair programming: keeping a running commentary, switching roles appropriately, and writing well thought-out code. I feel I struggled most when in the driver role; although the code we wrote was higher quality than what I could have written alone, I felt like I was still thinking of the bigger picture as I would when coding alone.

## What went well?
Through partner programming, my partner and wrote high quality code that we both had a thorough understanding. Stepping back into the code we wrote earlier in the week was especially easy, since we both had experience with it and it was more consistently written than what we wouldve written alone.

## What would you do differently?
I need to get more comfortable with the driver position, and let my code be led more strongly by the navigator. I would also switch roles more often; this last week, we would work without switching for a few hours when we were working out a feature.
