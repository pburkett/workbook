## What is code documentation? 
Code documentation is the practice of creating instructions for code.  It can be done internally, via comments held directly within the source code, or externally, via guides.

## What are some benefits of code documentation?
Code documentation increases reusability and makes open-source code much more powerful. Documentation is most powerful when developers collaborate, but it can be helpful even for solo developers, especially with the use of a tool like JSDocs.

## How important is code documentation?
If you would like to create a codebase that is maintainable, code documentation is essential. As codebases grow, the effort required to maintain the code grows as well. Code documentation is one of the most important tools developers have in decreasing the maintenance effort.
