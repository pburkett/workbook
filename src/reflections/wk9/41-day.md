## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
Our technologies are Vue.js, Express.js, SASS + bootstrap, Mongo DB, and Google's map API. Personally, I'm going to be thinking about following the single responsibility principle when writing Services on the server and client side, since my usage of that principle has been lacking in other projects.

## What went well so far?
Our planning seems to have been *almost* sufficient so far; our Kanban board could have been built built better. I essentially listed business rules as tasks on Kanban, instead of individual tasks that could be tackled individually. The board was still useful, but didn't serve it's purpose fully.  

## What would you do differently? Why?
I would spend even more time on the Figma. We spent roughly two days of work on it, but it was still somewhat incomplete. Designating more user actions would've been useful, and styling more consistently in general.
