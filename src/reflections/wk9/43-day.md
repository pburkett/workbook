## What is automated Software Development Testing?
Automated testing is the practice of testing software through automatic means. This can vary widely in scope. The two extremes are unit testing and UI testing.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
One of the primary goals is to save development time by reducing the demand for manual testing. It can also help teams produce much higher quality code, and allow those teams to 'trust' that code more than code without automated tests.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
The main potential drawback of testing is the time spent writing tests. Writing precise tests is time consuming, and it's not *always* worth the time spent. The other potential drawback is if tests are written poorly, or are not refactored if/when requirements for the tested code changes. Bad tests can become very problematic for developers trying to pass them!
