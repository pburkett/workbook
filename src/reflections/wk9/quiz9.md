# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is the broad concept of creating parent-child relationships for classes. Inheriting a class will inherit all of the methods connected to that class.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
`Singleton` classes are classes that are only instantiated once. MVC Services are a good example of Singleton patterns.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Observers are tools that watch pieces of data for changes. It's common to use these to trigger re-draws to the DOM when the data connected to them changes.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The strategy design pattern enables selecting algorithms at runtime. A good example is when validating incoming data. Instead of running one algorithm to check all cases, we can dynamically switch algorithms depending on the data coming in.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The factory design pattern is a way of creating objects without specifying the class of the object. For example, instead of instantiating inherited classes, we can instantiate the base class and use a parameter to inherit additional methods.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
TDD is the practice of writing tests *before* writing code, in the simplest of terms. This workflow has major consequences for how we code, many of which are positive. Writing tests before writing code not only garauntees high code-coverage, but it also encourages very deliberate and efficient code writing.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
DoD stands for Definition of Done. The practice of "defining done" helps keep scope creep in check, as we can more easily decide when our product is "done" when it meets the DoD.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:

```
Here are a couple example from my BCW Capstone, Curbsyde:
**customers can search for and view nearby businesses**
**Businesses can receive orders from customers and view pending orders**
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The `Sprint Planning Meeting` is when the sprint backlog will be created each Sprint.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Typically, tasks will be assigned at the beginning of the Sprint. However, the self-assignment Scrum principle says that tasks should be chosen by individual developers whenever possible, and not assigned by Scrum masters.
