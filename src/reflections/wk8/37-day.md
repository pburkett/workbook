## Why is communication on a small team important?
Just as communication is important for larger development teams, communication is important for continuous delivering high quality code as a small team. 

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
For small scrum teams, strictly following agile methodology may end up taking too much active development time away with meetings. The fewer developers on a team, the less time needs to be spent coordinating those developers. However, it's still important for a small team to have development meetings to communicate, and they may still want to communicate throughout the day. Informal meetings or messaging applications can both speed up the need to communicate very quickly and simply.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
The unattainable triangle is a triangle of three things you can prioritize: fast, good, and cheap. The concept of the triangle is that prioritizing one of these priorities inherently harms how well you can meet the other two. For example, if you try to meet a goal very quickly, the quality and cost-effectiveness will both suffer.
